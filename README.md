# Prime Number Checker :heavy_check_mark:

A simple C program to efficiently find prime numbers between 3 and 100.

## Overview :mag_right:

This program checks for prime numbers in the range from 3 to 100 using an efficient algorithm and prints them to the console.


## Features :rocket:

- Efficient prime number checking algorithm.
- Prints prime numbers between 3 and 100.
- Uses a concise and optimized implementation.

## How It Works :bulb:

The program follows these steps:

1. Initialize an array to store prime numbers and set default primes (2 and 3).
2. Loop through odd numbers from 5 to 100.
3. For each number, check if it's divisible by any prime number up to its square root.
4. If the number is not divisible by any prime, it's considered prime and added to the array.
5. Print the prime numbers found within the range.

## Example Output :bar_chart:

2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 23 29 31 37 41 43 47 53 59 61 67 71 73 79 83 89 97
